             <p>In 2018,<i>Time magazine</i> included him on its list of the 100 most influential people in the world.
                 Kohli has been deemed one of the most commercially viable athletes,
                  with estimated earnings of <b>₹584 crore (US$73 million)</b> in the year 2022.</p>
                  <b>Royal Challengers Bangalore</b>
                  <p>In 2007, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) introduced the Indian Premier League (IPL), 
                    a franchise-based Twenty20 league. Among the franchises, Royal Challengers Bangalore, owned by Vijay Mallya at the time,
                     selected Kohli to join their team for a sum of $30,000 through a draft. 
                    This decision was influenced by Kohli's performance in the Under-19 World Cup held in Malaysia.</p>
                    <b>2013–2014: Leadership role and tribulations in batting</b>
                    <p>Following Vettori's retirement, Kohli assumed the role of full-time captain for the Bangalore team starting from the 2013 season of the IPL.
                         Prior to the commencement of this season, he was highest run-scorer for Bangalore with a tally of<sub> 1,639 runs.</sub>
                         Kohli embarked on the tournament with a consistent start, but suffered a loss against the Sunrisers Hyderabad in an away game.
                          In their subsequent home match, once again against Hyderabad, Kohli scored unbeaten 93 while chasing, marking his highest individual score in Twenty20 cricket at that time.
                          Continuing his form, Kohli went on to score back-to-back fifties in the matches against the Chennai Super Kings and the Delhi Daredevils, the latter of which was decided through a super over.
                           After a defeat against the Mumbai Indians,Kohli found himself embroiled in a disagreement with the crowd due to their aggressive demeanour towards the visiting team at the Wankhede Stadium.
                            As the mid-season approached, Kohli encountered a dip in his performance, managing 45 runs in four innings.
                             He bounced back during the away game against Delhi, where he came close to achieving a century, scoring 99 before being run out on the final delivery.
                              With a strong start to the season that saw Bangalore occupying the top position in the table, the team's performance waned in the latter half of the tournament.
                               Kohli openly addressed the issue, attributing their decline to a lack of execution by the bowling unit.
                              In a bid to keep their playoff hopes alive, Bangalore confronted a must-win scenario in their final match against Chennai. Opening the innings, 
                              Kohli scored an unbeaten 56 in a rain-affected match, ultimately leading his team to victory.
                               However, Bangalore's hopes were shattered when the Hyderabad secured a win over the Kolkata Knight Ridersdashing their chances of advancing to the playoffs. 
                        As a result, Bangalore's season came to an end during the group stage.</p>
                        <p>Prior to the seventh season of the IPL, Kohli was retained by Bangalore for<b> ₹12.5 crore (US$1.6 million).</b>
                            His campaign commenced with an unbeaten score of 49 runs in a victorious encounter against the Delhi Daredevils.</p>
                            <p><b>2015–2016: Collective and individual success</b></p>
                            <p>At the outset of the 2015 season of the IPL, Kohli expressed his optimism about playing with reduced pressure, attributing it to the strengthened middle order of the Bangalore team.
                                 Kohli strategically decided to open the batting alongside Gayle for the season.
                                  In the second match against the Sunrisers Hyderabad, he scored 41 runs, providing a moderate start to his campaign.
                                   Continuing his form, Kohli achieved his first half-century of the season, albeit in a match that ended in defeat against the Chennai Super Kings.
                                   In the subsequent match, Kohli again notched a fifty, leading Bangalore to victory and ending their three-match losing streak.
                                    During this match, he exhibited his tactical acumen by promoting AB de Villiers up the batting order, recognizing the importance of having the team's premier batsman face more deliveries.
                                     Bangalore, looking to overcome their previous struggles in the bowling department, successfully bowled out the Delhi Daredevils for 95 runs, while Kohli guided his team to a ten-wicket victory during the chase.
                                      However, in an away game against Chennai, Kohli fell short of reaching a half-century, scoring 48 runs before being run out by Dwayne Bravo due to a momentary lapse in judgment. Bangalore's loss in that match marked the end of their winning streak.
                                       His standout innings of the season came against the Mumbai Indians, where he played a knock of 82 runs, forming a record-breaking 215-run partnership with de Villiers.
                                        In a rain-affected match against the Hyderabad, with a target of 83 runs to chase in six overs, Kohli scored quickfire 44 off 19 balls, earning him player of the match award.
                                         In the subsequent game, Kohli found himself entangled in an incident involving an anti-corruption code breach. Nonetheless, he managed to continue playing due to breach's absence of severity.
                                          Qualifying for the playoffs for the first time under his captaincy, Kohli held firm confidence in the turnaround his team had showcased during the later stages of the league.
                                           However, in the qualifier 2 against Chennai, Kohli's dismissal for 12 runs proved detrimental to Bangalore's chances, resulting in their defeat and the conclusion of their campaign for the season. 
                                Throughout the season, Kohli accumulated a total of 505 runs in 16 matches with an average of 45.90, then third-highest run tally achieved by him in a single season.</p>
